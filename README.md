# Medium Difficulty LeetCode Challenge Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing solutions to medium difficulty challenges on LeetCode! 

## About
This repository is a part of my personal challenge where I aim to solve one medium difficulty problem on LeetCode every day for 100 days. Previously, I completed a 50-day challenge where I solved one easy problem per day. This challenge is an effort to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Progress
- **Day 1-50:** Easy problems solved
- **Day 51-150:** Medium problems (current challenge)
- **Day 151-260:** Future challenges (TBD) 

## Getting Started
Each problem's solution is organized into its own directory and includes:
- README.md with a detailed problem description, examples and explanation of the solution's apprach.
- My solution.

Feel free to explore the solutions in this repository and use them for reference or learning purposes. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
